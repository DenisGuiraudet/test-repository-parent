# test-repository-parent

This repository tries a simplified version of version control than: https://github.com/DenisGuiraudet/test-submodule-parent

It is a parent repository with some child repositories.  
Later on, it should be used alongside a custom CLI/script to pull all children from the parent.

## Feedback

This is much simpler than submodules but requires dedicated scripts/CLI to pull all repos or change all branches in one go.  
This solution is quick and easy to start, yet can be extended to fit any requirements. üëç
